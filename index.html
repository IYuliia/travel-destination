          One of the most famous landmarks in Valencia is the City of Arts and
          Sciences, a stunning complex of futuristic buildings that house
          museums, an aquarium, and more. The Jardines del Turia is a beautiful
          park that runs through the city, with plenty of opportunities for
          walking, cycling, or just enjoying the scenery. The Barrio del Carmen
          is the historic heart of Valencia, with narrow streets and beautiful
          buildings that date back centuries. And of course, no trip to Valencia
          would be complete without indulging in some delicious paella, a
          traditional dish made with rice, vegetables, and seafood or meat.
